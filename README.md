# Dsc-phase-1-PROJECT
The goal of this project is to help the team that will be leading microsoft's new studio to choose the best and most profitable films.

In my analysis I have used both pandas and sqlite to clean and analyse my data
 
 During the data preparation process I had some missing data upon careful consideration I decided that deleting all the data would be a greater loss so I choose to fill the missing data with the mean.
 
 Inorder to be able to answer the business question I went about answering the following questions
 1. Which studio is making the best returns both domestically and internationally and which ones are not?

2. Which movie genres have the best ratings and what genre has the worst ratings?
